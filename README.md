# Character Ontology Paper: "Fans Reconstruct Heroes"

This repository accompanies the manuscript **"Fans Reconstruct Heroes: Modeling Fictional Characters in Participatory Culture"**, submitted to the *Semantic Web Journal* Special Issue on *Semantic Web and Ontology Design for Cultural Heritage*.

## 📜 Overview
The paper introduces **GOLEM Ontology** (Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models), a framework for modeling fictional characters across canonical and fan-created works. The ontology:
- Bridges literary theory with participatory culture
- Provides formal representation of dynamic, multi-contextual characters
- Ensures interoperability with CIDOC-CRM, DOLCE, and other standards

## 🧩 GOLEM Ontology Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mixed Approach** | Top-down (theory) + bottom-up (fan data) integration |
| **Modular Design** | Reusable components for characters, events, relationships, etc. |
| **Interoperability** | Aligns with CIDOC-CRM, DOLCE-Lite-Plus, and LRMoo |
| **Implementation** | Developed in Protégé, documented with PyLode |

## 🔍 Case Study: Greek Mythology Fanfiction
**Dataset**: 10 curated stories from AO3's *Ancient Greek Religion and Lore* fandom (tagged "Major Character Death")

### Methodology
1. **Annotation**:
   - Manual tagging of death events (victim, perpetrator, method)
   - LLM-assisted feature extraction (Deepseek-V3) with human correction
2. **Modeling**:
   - RDF conversion using GOLEM ontology
   - SPARQL querying for evaluation
